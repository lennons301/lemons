# Lemons — Household Management Platform

## Project Overview

Household management web app: recipes, meal planning, calendar, todos, inventory, shopping lists. Multi-household, per-person accounts.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (server-side logic)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Row Level Security)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password + OAuth)
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage (recipe images, avatars)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude API (recipe image extraction)
- **Secrets:** Doppler (source of truth for all environments)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library

## Commands

All dev commands run via Doppler to inject secrets:

```bash
doppler run -- npm run dev     # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
doppler run -- npm run build   # Production build (also runs TypeScript check)
doppler run -- npm run lint    # ESLint
doppler run -- npx vitest      # Unit tests
```

Doppler is the source of truth for secrets — never create `.env.local` manually with secrets.

Required secrets in Doppler (dev): `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
Required secrets in Doppler (stg/prd): above plus `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## Architecture

**Approach A: Next.js Full-Stack Monolith.** All server-side logic lives in `src/app/api/` route handlers and `src/lib/`.

### IMPORTANT: Approach B Escape Hatch

If complexity grows — particularly around AI processing, complex business logic, or performance — the `src/app/api/` routes and `src/lib/` modules are the extraction boundary for a **Python FastAPI backend (Approach B)**.

- `lib/ai/` — Claude API integration. First extraction candidate.
  - `lib/ai/meal-plan/` — LLM-assisted meal plan generation (conversation loop, tools). Highest-value extraction target given token volume.
- `lib/utils/` — Business logic (scaling, unit conversion, inventory matching). Second candidate.

**To migrate to Approach B:**
1. Stand up a FastAPI service implementing the same interfaces defined in `lib/`
2. Replace Next.js API routes with thin proxies to the Python service
3. Frontend code doesn't change

**When to consider migrating:**
- AI processing needs exceed Vercel serverless function limits (60s on free tier)
- Business logic becomes too complex for TypeScript (e.g. advanced meal plan optimization)
- Need Python-specific libraries (ML, data processing)
- Performance bottlenecks in serverless cold starts

## Deployment

- **Vercel** auto-deploys from `main` (production) and PR branches (preview)
- **Supabase migrations** run automatically on deploy via Supabase GitHub integration
- **Vercel project:** `lennons301s-projects/lemons`
- **Vercel CLI:** use `vercel ls`, `vercel logs <url>` to inspect deployments

## Secrets & Environment Isolation

**Never develop against the production database.**

```
Local dev:     Doppler dev config → local Docker Postgres (supabase start)
Interlude:     Doppler stg config → staging Supabase project (lemons-staging)
Preview/PR:    Vercel preview     → staging Supabase project (lemons-staging)
Production:    Doppler prd config → production Supabase project
```

**Doppler environments:**
- `dev` — local Supabase instance, test API keys
- `stg` — staging Supabase (lemons-staging). Used by Interlude agent containers and Vercel previews
- `prd` — production Supabase. Synced to Vercel production env vars

**Interlude agent setup:** Interlude stores a Doppler service token (scoped to `stg`) per project. On container start it pulls secrets from the Doppler API into `.env.local`. This means agents get the same secrets as Vercel preview deployments.

- Migrations are developed and tested locally first
- Verified on staging before production
- `supabase/seed.sql` provides repeatable test data for local/staging
- Supabase branching can be used if available on the plan
- **Note:** Local Docker/Supabase not always available (WSL2). Type regeneration may need to be done manually.

## Key Conventions

- **Server Components by default.** Client Components only where interactivity is needed.
- **Row Level Security on every table with `household_id`.** Authorization is enforced at the database level, not application level.
- **Ingredient names are normalized** (singular, lowercase, adjectives stripped) for matching across recipes, inventory, and shopping lists.
- **RRULE (RFC 5545)** for all recurrence (calendar events, recurring tasks).
- **Shopping lists are todo lists** with `list_type = 'shopping'`. No separate shopping entity.
- **Meal plan entries are not duplicated into calendar_events.** Calendar views query both tables and composite them.
- **Unified person model:** `household_persons` view unions `household_members` (adults with accounts) and `household_managed_members` (kids, no accounts). All features reference person IDs from this view.
- **Many-to-many relations** (tags, ingredients, recipe_members) use delete-and-reinsert on update. No upsert.
- **Member colors** are deterministic by ID hash (8 colors in `member-colors.ts`). Used for avatars, badges, calendar.
- **Claude API images** must be under 5MB base64. Frontend compresses all images before sending (iterative JPEG quality reduction).
- **Todo list templates** use `is_template` flag on `todo_lists`. Clone via `/api/todos/[id]/clone`. Templates are household-scoped.
- **Item groups** use `group_name` on `todo_items`. UI supports collapsible sections or tabs (persisted in localStorage per list).
- **Event-linked lists** use `event_id` FK on `todo_lists`. One list per event. Calendar events show linked list progress.
- **Recipe rotation** is a household-wide `in_rotation` boolean on `recipes` (default true). Out-of-rotation recipes stay in the library and manual meal picker with an "Out of rotation" badge; toggle via `PATCH /api/recipes/[id]` from the detail page or library card.
- **Packet sizes** live in `packet_sizes` (global rows, `household_id IS NULL`) with optional household overrides. Seeded from `supabase/seed_data/packet_sizes_uk.json` via `supabase/migrations/00017_packet_sizes_seed.sql` (regenerate with `npx tsx scripts/generate-packet-sizes-migration.ts`).
